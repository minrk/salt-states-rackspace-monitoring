salt-states-rackspace-monitoring
================================

Install the Rackspace Cloud Monitoring Agent, using Salt States.

This repo is just getting started and currently *only supports Ubuntu+Debian* at the moment. Fedora is in, but hasn't been tested yet.

Right now, this just runs through [installing the cloud monitoring agent](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/install-the-cloud-monitoring-agent). It doesn't run `rackspace-monitoring-agent --setup` for you (yet). :(
